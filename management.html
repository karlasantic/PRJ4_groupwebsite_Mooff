        <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
        <h2>Problems & solutions</h2>
            <h3>C1</h3>
                <p>n the first lean canvas, the problem that our team was trying to solve was lack of socializing within dog owners, which resulted in people not knowing or trusting where to leave their dogs while they are away, not knowing what the right routes are when it came to walking with their dog, and also what restaurants and cafes are dog-friendly.  </p>
                <p>The solution to this problem would have been to build a website which would connect the dog owners, bring them together by scheduling events to help them build relationships. The website would also be a platform where everyone could share their experiences and tips and make friends and valuable connections. </p>
                <p>Write a reflection on the choices made in creating choosing the trademark, including an analysis of the existing alternatives.</p>
            <h3>C2</h3>
                <p>n the second lean canvas, our team made many changes. We realized by conducting and evaluating the interviews we had conducted that the target group we were focusing on was not keen on meeting new people and socializing but wished to dedicate the time they spent with their dogs only to themselves. For this reason, we decided to shift our focus elsewhere. We managed to find another problem which was the feeling of unsafety that people experience while walking their dogs at night. Contributing to this were factors such as the lack of light gear for their pets with which they could stay in sight, and the unsafe feeling of being alone in the street.  </p>
                <p>The way to solve this problem was to provide a map which shows the layout of the city streetlights, which would help people find the best well-lit path to walk their dog in. This map would also have a live feature showing the busyness of a street or a neighbourhood so that the owners can know what to expect to find, whether they would like to avoid the crowd or perhaps they feel safer following it. To always keep their dog in sight, safety gear such as dog harnesses with lights would be sold.  </p>
            <h3>C3</h3>
                <p>n the final lean canvas, by assesing the interviews we came to some minor improvements. The problem remains the feelings of unease and unsafeness that dog owners face while walking their dog, however we decided to change it to the dark times of the day. This considers early mornings as well as evenings and night, as these are all parts of day when the feelings of unsafety can arise due to lack of light. Lack of information about well-lit streets and busy areas, as well as a lack of good quality dog light gear also remain the problem. </p>
                <p>To solve this, the website will provide a map with a layout of streetlights and updates about the busyness of the area, as well as live updates which users can write. These updates are comments made by people on the map, warning other users if there is something in the area worth paying attention to. This feature makes the website resemble a community, allowing people to collaborate and help each other. Also, light gear such as light harnesses for dogs will be sold in order to make the dogs always visible to their owners.  </p>
        <h2>Unique value proposition & unfair adventage</h2>
            <h3>C1</h3>
                <p>The unique value proposition of Breda Barks was to connect the dog owner community, provide them with support and evoke the feeling of reliability, and all of that with a touch of playfulness to keep it fun. The brand vision was to push people towards helping each other as they are stronger together.  

                    Unfair advantage of the brand was simply providing a trustworthy dog-owner community in Breda, which does not exist in Breda yet.  </p>
            <h3>C2</h3>
                <p>Mooff is unique because it provides support for dog owners, also evoking the feeling of reliability, though this time the emphasis is on relying on the company more than on other members. The goal of the website is to empower dog owners and provide them with the feeling of safety.  

                    The unfair advantage is that the  website provides an overview of the city lights map, and uses live features to show where it is most busy. Another interesting aspect is that locations can be commented upon by members. </p>
            <h3>C3</h3>
                <p>The unique value proposition remained without many changes. Mooff helps people overcome the feeling of unease while walking their dog at the times of day when there is no daylight by providing them with information so they can be in control of their surroundings. 

                    Something that isn't easily copied remained the integration of a street light map with live busyness and comments features</p>
        <h2>Customer segments & cahnnels</h2>
            <h3>C1</h3>
            <p>The first concept (Breda Barks) was targeted towards dog owners aged 25-45, living in the Breda city centre, interested in socializing, travelling who have an active lifestyle. This way the website was targeted towards people who are more likely to be mature and reliable, share simmilar interests and habits. 

                The audience was to be reached on Instagram which would be connected to Facebook. These two platforms were chosen in order to reach such a wide audience, with the younger members being mostly active on Instagram, and the older members on Facebook.  </p>
            <h3>C2</h3>
            <p>Mooff is targeted to dog owners aged 16-30. This age group fit the target audience as after conducting the interviews we noticed that people within this age group are more likely to use such a website, while they also share simmilar interests. The age differences in the first lean canvas were more significant, which could make our brand not targeted enough, and the audience would be more difficult to reach. The target audience is of all genders living in Breda city centre with an active lifestyle. 

                To reach this audience better, we decided to use Instagram as well as TikTok as these are the most commonly used apps by people of our target age. Also, Facebook is incomporated by using reels in order to reach individuals still attached to the platform. </p>
            <h3>C3</h3>
            <p>The target audience has not changed since the second lean canvas. 

                It was decided to leave Facebook out as a distribution channel due to the fact that the majority of the audience is more likely to use Instagram and Tiktok only. For the distribution, both platforms are used, however the emphasis is on Instagram posts and reels, using TikTok to reach more people due to the algorithm being more favourable on this platform. </p>
        <h2>Key metrics</h2>
                <h3>C1</h3>
                    <p>In the first lean canvas, it was planned to track the number of people who become members of the community in order to measure how the company is doing. This was because the platform would have a subscription fee which would ensure that people become members. </p>
                <h3>C2</h3>
                    <p>In the second lean canvas, numbers of customers reached through socials (including views and followers) would be measured, as well as numbers of website visits. </p>
                <h3>C3</h3>
                    <p>n the third lean canvas, the way of measuring the success of the company remained the same as in the second canvas, with an additional tracking of how many products (dog harnesses) are sold. </p>
        <h2>Cost structure & revenue streams</h2> 
            <h3>C1</h3>
                <p>The cost structure of the website was made out of the social media marketing, word of mouth, and building the website. Fixes costs would be dedicated to marketing, and variable costs are building and improving the website.  

                    Revenue streams were coming from a subscription fee which would be used in order to use the website.  </p>
                <p>Cost structure in the second lean canvas consisted of producing the products we intend to sell, social media marketing and website development. The fixed costs were the social media marketing, while variable costs were the production costs (as they would change depending on the demand) and the website development and improvement. 

                    The revenue streams are coming from selling products and advertising external clients. This way the platform could remain free of subscription and still generate income by being a platform for advertising.  </p>
            <h3>C2</h3>
                <p>The third lean canvas did not change much from the second one, main costs still being producing harnesses (variable), website keeping (variable) and social media marketing (fixed). Costs per unit of our products are estimated to be  €10 – €15 depending on the size of the harness.  

                    Revenue streams come primarily from sales, a price per piece is estimated at €20. The team opted out of gaining revenue by advertisement as after conducting the interviews, this seemed to draw the audience away from the product. An estimation of 120 dog harnesses in the first year is sold (around 2400 euros profit). This estimation is based on 50% of our interviews saying they would buy dog harnesses from our website, and by calculating a steady customer gain of 20 followers a month, multiplying this by the price of €20.   </p>
        <h2>Product/service</h2>
            <h3>C1</h3>
                    <p>Breda Barks would sell the platform itself. That is, members could join by paying a subscription fee, which would give them access to the website. This service could help connect people and give them a platform to communicate and connect. </p>
            <h3>C2</h3>
                    <p>Mooff would provide the customers with an option to buy products such as dog harnesses. This plays into the value of safety, as it allows the dog owners to always be able to keep an eye on their dog in the dark. This also corresponds with reliability, as they are able to rely on the product, and therefore our website as well. </p>
            <h3>C3</h3>
                    <p>The product in the third lean canvas remained the same as in the second one, it also connects to the customers and the brand vision as our interviews confirmed that this is something they are willing to use and considered it to be a good idea. </p>
