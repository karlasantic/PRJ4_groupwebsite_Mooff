        <li>User interface patterns (e.g. grids, carousels, menu organizations etc.)</li>
        <li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)</li>
        <li>All these elements must be justified by referring to the theory <strong>and/or vocabulary</strong> of design</li>
        <li>Please relate these elements to other units, for example:
          <ul>

            <li>How does website design help showcase the <strong>unique value proposal of the product</strong>?</li>

      <h4 id="production-2" class="mt-2">Credits</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>this website was derived solely from the course provided template (<a href="https://github.com/buas-media-interactive/prj4-group-template" target="_blank">buas-media-interactive/prj4-group-template</a>)</li>
        <li>All images and icons were created by the team, in the Canva Suite
      </ul>
      <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
        <p>The participants are given a task to go through the website and enter the product page. Besides that, the test participants will be given the website without prior knowledge of what the website is for, and after doing the testing, they will be asked to explain what the brand is about.   </p>
        <p>The participants consist of dog owners who live in the Breda city centre, within the age of 16 and 30 years old. They will be asked to voice their thoughts out loud in order for us to assess what their thought process is, hopefully reaching new findings or issues we did not think of.  </p>
      <h2>Findings</h2>
        <h3>First testing round (Figma Demo)</h3>
        <p>The Figma prototype consisted of basic design layout and functionality, with minimal (brand vision) explanations and copyright text.  
          The users were clear on the fact that the brand is for animals, once they read further, they were clear on the fact that is for dogs.            
          The websites primary product was a map but due to the layout of the page, users were confused with the priority on the harness. </p>
        <h3>Second testing round (website)</h3>
          <p>The users were given a task to look through the landing page and access the product website. 

            Once they opened the website, the users were met with a landing animation displaying the logo and they were clear on the animal motives and that the brand involves animals (dogs). </p>
          <p>Once they scrolled through, they were met with the download the map segment. Two of the users wondered if the map is only meant for dog walks. It was unclear to them the actual functionalities of the map. While two of the others have not commented on the possible usage but were satisfied with the provided product explanation. </p>
          <p>The main task was to find the product page and access which they all successfully found. Some of them accessed it through the carousel feature clicking on their desired harness colour but struggled to go back to the assortment product page. They had to take a few extra moments to locate the products page in the navigation bar. </p>
          <p>The male tester and the 26-year-old women tester went through the navigation bar to access the product page where they were met with an overall product explanation before choosing a specific product. </p>
          <p>All of the users tried adding the item to cart due to the button being present, however hat functionality is still not possible on the presentable website. </p>
