            BRAND	 
            
            In the current age we live in, there is a growing concern for both personal safety and the well-being of pets, as well as increasing urbanization and pet ownership. Mooff offers a solution by providing a website that makes dog owners in Breda feel more secure. The service is especially made for walking dogs in the evenings or in dark conditions, enabling users' convenience. In Breda's niche market for dog walking services that prioritize safety, there is minimal competition. 
            
            Mooff's core value proposition revolves around support, reliability, empowerment, and safety. The website makes use of digital technology to give users information about busy areas, well-lit walking routes, and alerts them when needed, enabling them to walk their dogs safely even at night. On the website, users can also purchase products that help improve the feeling of security, such as harnesses with built-in lights and other accessories. 
            
             
            
            TARGET GROUP  
            
            The target group consists of dog owners of all genders, aged 16 till 30 years old. As the platform will be launched to use in the city centre of Breda, Mooff will also target people who live in the city centre of Breda. The occupations of the people within the target group varies, including students, young professionals, and business professionals.  
            
            Overall, they have an active lifestyle and try to include their dog in their busy city-life as much as possible. They value socializing and meeting with friends. However, they also contend with occasional feelings of insecurity and vulnerability, particularly during evening or nighttime walks with their dog. Although not necessarily seeking a dog owner community, they value safety and may appreciate connections with other dog owners for safety tips and recommendations. 
            
            People within the target group have an active present on social media. They are mostly active on platforms as Instagram (Instagram: Age Distribution of Global Audiences 2023 | Statista, 2023) and TikTok (Statista, 2023a). For entertainment, information, and social interaction. They are comfortable using digital tools and platforms for everyday tasks. 
            
            People within the age category of the target audience find it important for their jobs to offer them flexible work schedules and value a great work-life balance (Carino, 2019). It has also been proven that this target group and especially woman deal with the feeling of unsafety walking their dog (Barker, 2022). 
            
            Values of the target audience are safety: for themselves and their pets, convenience, and social responsibility.  
            
            Mooff is made specifically for people who walk their dog(s) in the evenings, or in general when it is dark outside, and feel unsafe, despite knowing there is no ‘direct danger.’  
            
             
            
            COMMUNICATION OBJECTIVES 
            
            The objectives as mentioned in the Communication & Media Plan are also present and described in excellent detail, in SMART method. 
            
            Reach objective = we want to reach 100 people in one month through our posts on Instagram. Justification: By reaching this specific number of individuals, we aim to increase awareness of the Mooff platform and its safety features among our target audience in Breda. The number of impressions and engagements on our Instagram posts will be tracked to ensure we reach the specific target. Citizens in the city centre of Breda: https://allecijfers.nl/gemeente/breda/ (around 30,000) 12% of the citizens in Breda have a dog:  https://www.prinspetfoods.nl/nl_NL/actueel/huisdierbezitters#:~:text=In%20de%20drie%20grote%20steden,heeft%20%C3%A9%C3%A9n%20of%20meerdere%20katten which is then 3,600, so a reach of 500 should be doable.  
            
             
            
            Affect objective = Intrigue the target audience about the possibilities offered by Mooff, make them feel interested and curious about the brand by the 1st of April. This will lead to more engagement with Mooff and ultimately new users/ followers of the website. By observing the engagement on our posts such as likes, comments, and shares the audiences' interests and curiosity can be measured. By creating compelling content and starting our #LetsMooff campaign, we may successfully draw in and hold the interest of our target audience.  
            
             
            
            Response objective = We want 75% of the accounts reached to follow our social media by the 1st of April. We want 25% of the accounts reached to visit our website by the 1st of April. Website visits and user interactions can help us reaching our goal of increasing the usage of Mooff and buying our products. We will keep track of post reach and post interactions (likes and interactions). TikTok: We will keep track of video views, likes and profile views. By providing clear call-to-actions, we can encourage website visits and engagement with the platform.  
            
             
            
             
            
            MEDIA TACTICS 
            
            Instagram: Instagram is a highly visual platform that resonates well with Mooff's target audience, who are active on social media for entertainment, information, and social interaction. With over 500 million daily active users (Statista, 2023b), Instagram provides a large audience base for Mooff to reach potential customers effectively. Instagram is great for its unique features such as Stories, Reels, and Posts, in this way Mooff can create engaging and interactive content. Using this social media platform Mooff can strategically make use of hashtags and geotagging, and so increasing visibility within the local community of Breda and attract dog owners who may feel concerned about walking their dog sometimes.  
            
            TikTok: TikTok is a rapidly growing platform with a much younger audience than other social media platforms (Statista, 2023b). Making it a reliable platform for Mooff’s target audience of 16-30 years old. Mooff can benefit from TikTok's algorithm, which prioritizes content according to user engagement and interest. This will provide an easy and free way to target our audience. Lastly, by participating in challenges, TikTok trends, and using popular sounds, Mooff can effectively get the attention of TikTok users and drive them towards the brand and website. Before starting the campaign, our team conducted interviews with the target group where these statistics were confirmed.  
            
             
            
            THE CAMPAIGN 
            
            Our #LetsMooff campaign is focused on resolving the safety concerns of Breda's young urban dog owners. Mooff provides a solution made especially to ensure the safety and well-being of dogs and their owners when walking their dog. The #LetsMooff campaign's main goal is to provide dog owners the tools they need to feel safe and confident while taking their dogs for walks, no matter the time of day. 
            
            In terms of promotional activities, Mooff implemented a multi-channel approach to effectively reach our target audience and achieve our objectives. Based on the statistics and the interviews previously mentioned, our chosen platforms are TikTok and Instagram. Mooff created engaging content especially targeted on the #LetsMooff theme to get everyone inspired to Mooff (move) with confidence and security while walking their dog.  
            
            On these platforms we will make posts during the week on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday since these are the best days to post according to Kolowich (2018) As for the times, according to Kanuri (2018), over-all the best times to post on social media are between 15 PM and 17 PM. Our chosen content format will be reels and still (edited) images for Instagram as well as videos for TikTok. 
            
            Mooff created #MooffMonday, weekly content where every Monday we share an invaluable safety tip about/ for dog. More engaging content from our content calendar includes “Did You Know” videos shedding a light on fun facts about dog’s and their safety. Additionally, Mooff creates product posts to highlight and inform you about what products and services Mooff offers, seasonal posts to celebrate the holidays such as Happy Easter and April Fools. And lastly, we actively engage with the younger segment of our target group by hopping on the latest TikTok trends.  
            
            Launching the #LetsMooff hashtag campaign invited dog owners to join us in our mission to prioritize safety and empowerment during every walk #BrighterWalkAfterDark.  
            
            We created the following Content Calander based on this campaign: Social Media Planning Mooff 
            
             
            
            LEARNINGS  
            
            Throughout the first month of the #LetsMooff campaign, our team learned a lot. It showed us how important it is to understand your target group and to identify their social media usage. Researching our target audience and conducting interviews enabled us to create content that maximized our reach in the first month of our campaign.  
            
            In the beginning we struggled a little with finding the right post structed for Instagram, however after some team meetings and rearranging posts we figured it out. We saw that some posts such as the “Did You Know” reels were doing quite well, so we started posting them more regularly. Instagram’s insight showed us that the ‘meme’ videos and posts worked quite well, this did not resonate with our brand a lot and thus we tried making seasonal posts about Easter, April Fools, and more, that hopefully would have the same effect and be a better fit for Mooff. 
            
            When it comes to consistency and posting times, our initial research suggested posting on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday ; which worked well, however the times at which we made our posts initially proved to be less engaging, so by checking our insights and we changed them from 15PM to starting to post between 9AM-12PM. Additionally, we encountered some difficulties with gaining followers from the right demographic of our target audience and we decided to conduct some research and the team did some promotion on our personal accounts trying to reach the right target group. Mooff even got an offer of an American dog company asking to collaborate to both profit from the collaboration and reach more following. 
            
            For the second platform TikTok we had a different approach. The same videos that were posted on Instagram reels were posted on TikTok, but with a popular TikTok sound. The account did not get much following; however, it did get a lot of views on certain videos. We tried to keep up that kind of videos and focus on views rather than followers.  
            
            Although the campaign was short, we managed to gather enough insights to better our future planning for the upcoming weeks of the campaign. By preparing our content calendar ahead of time we managed to easily keep on top of our posting schedule and adjust things before posting them if necessary. It is also helpful to monitor when posts start to get too repetitive or less engaging for the audience. Over-all our biggest learning points are that consistency, research and attention to the target audience are key for a successful marketing campaign. 
            
             
            
             
            
            FUTURE PLANNING  
            
            During the 4-week execution of our campaign, we learned a lot and we examined the success of the promotion by checking if our initial goals were met.  
            
            Reach objective = we want to reach 100 people in one month through our posts on Instagram. This objective has proven to be successful with 112 reaches on Instagram (Appendix 1). 
            
             
            
            Affect objective = Intrigue the target audience about the possibilities offered by Mooff, make them feel interested and curious about the brand by the 1st of April. On Instagram we measured this aspect by tracking post reaches (with the highest post reach being 67- Appendix 2) and accounts engaged (with 32 total- Appendix 3). On TikTok we kept track of video views (971-Appendix 4). Moving forward we will keep measuring the same KPI's for our affect objective, but we will adjust the content that we post in order of bettering our results. 
            
             
            
            Response objective = We want 75% of the accounts reached to follow our social media by the 1st of April. We want 25% of the accounts reached to visit our website by the 1st of April (which means 75 followers and 25 accounts to visit our website). When it comes to followers on Instagram, we reached 55, which is a little below what we expected, and on TikTok the following was only 2. This shows that even though we had a large reach, we did not manage to convert as many people as we would have wanted into followers. To correct that, we will adjust our response objective to a specific number of followers that we want to have reached in the upcoming 4 weeks instead of basing our following performance on a percentage of the reach.  
            
            When it comes to people visiting our website, this goal has not been monitored due to the website not being finished. However, we would like to keep this objective for the coming weeks since the website will become available.  
            
            With these learning points in mind, we have created a new Content Calendar for the upcoming four weeks: Social Media Planning Mooff Future
