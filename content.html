        <h2>Information about the product itself</h2>
            <p>Ready to brighten up your walk?</p>
           <p> We want to be there with you and your dog, every step of your adventure together. That is why our light
            products are made to last forever. No need to worry about charging, the batteries of the dog harness charge
            automatically while your dog walks. We do not take it lightly. We promise you and your dog will never run out
            of light anymore, paw promise.</p>

           <p> Our light harness + your dog + mud baths = a match made in heaven. Dogs will be dogs, we all know that.
            Therefore, mud baths are sometimes unavoidable. Isn't it great that our light harnesses can be machinewashed? We thought so too.</p>
           <p> All (dog) sizes matter. That is why the light harness is designed to easily be adjusted to the size of your dog.
            Allowing every dog, no matter what breed, to shine.</p>

            areas, guides you through well-lit paths and alerts you ahead of time of situations close by, when needed.
            Mooff into your walks with confidence, knowing we will Mooff with you.</p>
            <p> How it works? That is simple. Based on your location and preferred walking distance, the Mooff Map will
            create a personalised route. Whether you are looking for a luminous path to walk on or an area where more
            dog owners are present, the Mooff Map will point it all out to you.</p>
           <p>Now, the only thing for you left to do is finding the leash and asking your dog to join you for a walk outside.
            We will take care of the rest. Let’s Mooff!</p>
