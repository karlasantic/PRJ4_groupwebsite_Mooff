        <h2 id="brandpersona">Brand persona</h2>
        <img src="images/annapersona.jpg"  class="img-fluid" alt="Brand persona">
            <p><b>Name:</b> Anna van Doorn</p>
            <p><b>Age:</b> 26</p>
            <p><b>Occupation:</b> Online Marketeer</p>
            <p><b>Location:</b> Breda, the Netherlands</p>
            <p>Anna van Doorn is a twenty-six year old woman, living in a house
                with a small garden in the city centre of Breda. Anna graduated
                two years ago and works as an online marketeer for a well-known
                international fashion brand. Her position allows her to work
                remotely. As she is a true home bird, she does not mind working
                from home. Her mother, however, is concerned she spends too much time alone behind her
                laptop and therefore urged her to get a dog. Anna was sceptical at first, but encouraged by her
                mother and best friend Mirthe, who owns a dog as well, she decided to get a dog. That was two
                months ago and so far, she has little regrets. Juuls, her dog, has quickly become part of her
                lifestyle. Taking him with her on long beach walks, visiting friends and family and enjoying nights
                in watching Netflix series.</p>
                <p>Some more general information about Anna. She has a diverse group of friends, is very conscious
                of what she eats, and sometimes struggles to balance meeting friends and spending enough time
                with family, while also staying active. She tries to swim at least two times a week, but in the end,
                often prioritizes social activities over working out. Besides her social activities, Anna values
                spending time alone and her independence. Her work gets her a salary that allows her to live
                comfortably, without having to worry too much about her finances. She is ambitious regarding her
                job and loves sharing her life on social media.
                Anna has quite a large amount of followers on Instagram. On her account, she shares her daily life
                with Juuls and fashion insights. She is inclined to spend more than 1,5 hours a day on Instagram,
                which is her most used social media platform.</p>
                <p>Besides being a home bird, Anna is a night owl. Meaning she often stays up late to finish things for
                work, her social media page or meeting friends. Despite being a night owl, Anna has been
                experiencing feelings of uneasiness while taking Juuls on his final walk, before she goes to bed.
                She therefore often tries to walk together with her best friend Mirthe or only goes for a small loop
                close to her house. She has been talking about this feeling with her friends and mom, but cannot
                quite pinpoint what causes this feeling.</p>
                <p>In general, Anna is eager to live her life to the fullest. She is happy with the life she lives together
                with Juuls, but is also still on the lookout for a man to potentially start a family with. She
                sometimes worries about her possibilities of starting a family in her early thirties, if she spends
                enough time with her friends and family and in general, she is inclined to worry about little things,
                despite being happy with her life. This keeps her awake at night from time to time. For now, her
                focus is on her career, personal well-being, expanding her social media page and finding the right
                work-friends-family-health balance. Anna enjoys it when she can push her boundaries and get out
                of her comfort zone. Through everything, she tries to keep a positive attitude and motivates herself
                to continue working on her life goals.</p>

            <p>Ready to brighten up your walk?</p>
           <p> We want to be there with you and your dog, every step of your adventure together. That is why our light

           <p> Our light harness + your dog + mud baths = a match made in heaven. Dogs will be dogs, we all know that.
            Therefore, mud baths are sometimes unavoidable. Isn't it great that our light harnesses can be machinewashed? We thought so too.</p>

              guides you through well-lit paths and alerts you ahead of time, when needed. Mooff into your walks with confidence, knowing we will Mooff with you.</p>
                <p> How it works? That is simple. Based on your location and preferred walking distance, the Mooff Map will
                create a personalised route. Whether you are looking for a luminous path to walk on or an area where more
                dog owners are present, the Mooff Map will point it all out to you.</p>
            <p>Now, the only thing for you left to do is finding the leash and asking your dog to join you for a walk outside.
                We will take care of the rest. Let’s Mooff!</p>
